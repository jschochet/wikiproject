    <h1>In popular culture</h1>

    <p>The phrase "the greatest thing since sliced bread" is a common hyperbole used
    to praise an invention or development. A writer for The Kansas City Star wrote
    that "the phrase is the ultimate depiction of innovative achievement and
    American know-how."</p>

    <p>In 1940, a package of bread consisting of two wrapped half-loaves was
      advertised as the "greatest convenience since sliced bread".</p>
