        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Otto Frederick Rohwedder of Davenport, Iowa, United States, invented the first single loaf bread-slicing machine. A prototype he built in 1912 was destroyed in a fire
            and it was not until 1928 that Rohwedder had a fully working machine ready. The first commercial use of the machine was by the Chillicothe Baking Company of Chillicothe,
            Missouri, which sold their first slices on July 7, 1928. Their product, "Kleen Maid Sliced Bread", proved to be a success. The bread was advertised
            as "the greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped."</p>

        <p>St. Louis baker Gustav Papendick bought Rohwedder's second bread slicer and set out to improve it by devising a way to keep the slices together at least long enough to allow
           the loaves to be wrapped. After failures trying rubber bands and metal pins, he settled on placing the slices into a cardboard tray. The tray aligned the slices, allowing mechanized
           wrapping machines to function.</p>

        <p>W.E. Long, who promoted the Holsum Bread brand, used by various independent bakers around the country, pioneered and promoted the packaging of sliced bread beginning in 1928.
           In 1930 Wonder Bread, first sold in 1925, started marketing sliced bread nationwide.</p>

        <p class="bold"><b>Did you know?</b></p>
        <p>For many years, Battle Creek, Michigan has claimed to be the first place Rohwedderâ€™s bread slicing machine was used, and the first place where sliced bread was sold.</p>
        <p>However, new evidence shows that bread was first machine-sliced for sale at Chillicothe Baking Company's.</p>
