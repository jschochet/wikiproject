  <h1>Effects</h1>

  <p>As commercially sliced bread resulted in uniform and somewhat thinner slices, people
  ate more slices of bread at a time. They also ate bread more frequently, because of the
  ease of getting and eating another piece of bread. This increased consumption of bread and, in turn, increased
  consumption of spreads, such as jam, to put on the bread.</p>
