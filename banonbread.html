    <h1>1943 U.S. ban on sliced bread</h1>

    <p>During 1943, U.S. officials imposed a short-lived ban on sliced bread as
    a wartime conservation measure. The ban was ordered by Claude R. Wickard
    who held the position of Food Administrator, and took effect on January
    18, 1943. According to The New York Times, officials explained that "the
    ready-sliced loaf must have a heavier wrapping than an unsliced one if
    it is not to dry out." It was also intended to counteract a rise in the
    price of bread, caused by the Office of Price Administration's authorization
    of a ten percent increase in flour prices.</p>

    <p>In a Sunday radio address on January 24, New York City Mayor LaGuardia suggested
    that bakeries that had their own bread-slicing machines should be allowed to
    continue to use them, and on January 26, 1943, a letter appeared in The New York
    Times from a distraught housewife:</p>

        <p><i>I should like to let you know how important sliced bread is to the morale
        and saneness of a household. My husband and four children are all in a rush
        during and after breakfast. Without ready-sliced bread I must do the slicing
        for toast—two pieces for each one—that's ten. For their lunches I must cut
        by hand at least twenty slices, for two sandwiches apiece. Afterward I make
        my own toast. Twenty-two slices of bread to be cut in a hurry!</i></p>

    <p>On January 26, however, John F. Conaboy, the New York Area Supervisor of the
    Food Distribution Administration, warned bakeries, delicatessens, and other
    stores that were continuing to slice bread to stop, saying that "to protect the
    cooperating bakeries against the unfair competition of those who continue to
    slice their own bread... we are prepared to take stern measures if necessary."</p>

    <p>On March 8, 1943, the ban was rescinded. While public outcry is generally
    credited for the reversal, Wickard stated that "Our experience with the order,
    however, leads us to believe that the savings are not as much as we expected,
    and the War Production Board tells us that sufficient wax paper to wrap sliced
    bread for four months is in the hands of paper processor and the baking industry."</p>
