        <h1>U.S. ban on sliced bread</h1>
        <p>During 1943, U.S. officials imposed a short-lived ban on sliced bread as
        a wartime conservation measure. The ban was ordered by Claude R. Wickard
        who held the position of Food Administrator, and took effect on January
        18, 1943. According to The New York Times, officials explained that "the
        ready-sliced loaf must have a heavier wrapping than an unsliced one if
        it is not to dry out." It was also intended to counteract a rise in the
        price of bread, caused by the Office of Price Administration's authorization
        of a 10% increase in flour prices.</p>

        <p>In a Sunday radio address on January 24, New York City Mayor LaGuardia suggested
        that bakeries that had their own bread-slicing machines should be allowed to
        continue to use them, and on January 26, 1943, a letter appeared in The New York
        Times from a distraught housewife:</p>

            <p><i>I should like to let you know how important sliced bread is to the morale
            and saneness of a household. My husband and four children are all
            in a rush during and after breakfast. Without ready-sliced bread I must do the slicing
            for toast—two pieces for each one—that's ten. For their lunches I must cut
            by hand at least twenty slices, for two sandwiches apiece. Afterward I make
            my own toast. Twenty-two slices of bread to be cut in a hurry!</i></p>

        <p>On January 26, however, John F. Conaboy, the New York Area Supervisor of the
        Food Distribution Administration, warned bakeries, delicatessens, and other
        stores that were continuing to slice bread to stop, saying that "to protect the
        cooperating bakeries against the unfair competition of those who continue to
        slice their own bread... we are prepared to take stern measures if necessary."</p>

        <p>On March 8, 1943, the ban was rescinded. While public outcry is generally
        credited for the reversal, Wickard stated that "Our experience with the order,
        however, leads us to believe that the savings are not as much as we expected,
        and the War Production Board tells us that sufficient wax paper to wrap sliced
        bread for four months is in the hands of paper processor and the baking industry."</p>

        <p class="bold"><b>Did you know?</b></p>
        <p class="side">There were many possible reasons for the ban. One main reason was to save on wax paper consumption.</p>

        <p class="side">It has also been suggested that a secondary goal was to try to conserve wheat and to lower bread and flour prices due to World War II.</p>
        <p class="side">It has also been suggested that one of the reasons for this bread ban was to conserve this steel.</p>
