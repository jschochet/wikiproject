  <h1>Around the world</h1>

  <p>Due to its convenience, sliced bread is popular in many parts of the world, and the usual thickness varies by company and country:</p>

  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">

    <li>In the United Kingdom, sliced bread is sold as either "Extra Thick", "Thick", "Medium" or "Thin" varying across the 5–20 mm range.</li>
    <li>In the Republic of Ireland, the most popular bread type is known as "sliced pan", sold in 800- or 400-gram loaves, wrapped in wax paper,
        with the slices conveniently sized for making sandwiches and toast.</li>
    <li>In Japan, the same half-loaf of bread is labeled by the number of slices (usually 4, 5, 6, or 7, and occasionally 8 or 10). Thin sliced
        crustless "sandwich bread" is also sold in Japan, since regular 4–6 slice bread is deemed too thick.</li>
    <li>In Canada and the United States, Texas toast is a type of packaged bread which is sliced at double the typical thickness of most sliced
        breads.</li>
